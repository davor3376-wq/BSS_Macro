AGENTS.md
1. System Protocol: "The Hive Consensus"
Objective: Zero-hallucination, high-performance automation for BSS. Framework: 200 Specialized Agents divided into 6 Guilds. Source of Truth: * BSS_Info.json (Mechanics, Quest Requirements, Mob HP).

BSS_Coordinates.json (Vector3 Map for every field and NPC).

2. Guild Assignments
Guild A: The Architects (Agents 001 - 020)
Agent 001 (Lead): Orchestrates the Main Loop (FSM).

Agent 002 (The Librarian): Manages BaseClass.lua. Responsible for lazy-loading JSON data using readfile.

Agent 003 (UI Architect): Handles Rayfield Suite integration.

Agent 004 (The Auditor): Compiles all modules into a final Delta-compatible bundle.

Agents 005-020: Configuration persistence and error-handling routines.

Guild B: The Navigators (Agents 021 - 055)
Agent 021 (Physics Lead): Manages Navigator.lua.

Agents 022-035 (Tween Masters): Calculate dynamic speeds. If "Walk Speed" is toggled, they override Humanoid.WalkSpeed; if "Tween" is used, they calculate CFrame paths.

Agents 036-045 (Obstacle Analysts): Refer to BSS_Coordinates.json to create "Safety Zones" (e.g., preventing the bot from falling off the edge at Mountain Top).

Agents 046-055 (Pathfinders): Handle specific "hard-to-reach" spots like the Star Hall or Dapper Bear’s shop.

Guild C: The Harvesters (Agents 056 - 100)
Agent 056 (Harvest Lead): Manages Collector.lua.

Agents 057-075 (Token Evaluators): Constant Workspace scanning. They compare found tokens against the "Priority List" in Tab 2.

Agents 076-085 (Passive Monitors): Check for "Pop Star" or "Gummy Star" buffs. If active, they force the Navigator to stay in specific zones.

Agents 086-100 (Field Mechanics): Handle "Auto Sprinkler", "Auto Dig", and "Farm Bubbles/Coconuts".

Guild D: The Slayers (Agents 101 - 140)
Agent 101 (Combat Lead): Manages Slayer.lua.

Agents 102-120 (Boss Specialists): * Unit 102: Coconut Crab (Circle-strafe logic).

Unit 103: Stump Snail (AFK-logic).

Unit 104: Commando Chick (Tween-evasion).

Agents 121-130 (Mob Sweepers): Routine checks for Ladybugs/Rhinos in current fields.

Agents 131-140 (Gear Swappers): Auto-equip Demon Mask or Diamond Mask based on boss/pollen needs.

Guild E: The Strategists (Agents 141 - 180)
Agent 141 (Logic Lead): Manages QuestBot.lua.

Agents 142-170 (Bear Analysts): Each agent is assigned to a specific NPC (e.g., Agent 142 = Black Bear). They parse BSS_Info.json to verify current quest steps.

Agents 171-180 (Resource Managers): Handle the "Convert at %" logic and decide when to use Micro-Converters vs. returning to Hive.

Guild F: The Hallucination Wardens (Agents 181 - 200)
Agents 181-190 (Logic Debaters): Their ONLY job is to find mistakes. If an agent writes code that isn't in the JSON, they flag it.

Agents 191-200 (Delta Optimization): Ensure all code is optimized for mobile execution (no memory leaks).

3. Communication Standards
Every script generated by the agents must follow this header format:

Lua
-- [Guild Reference]: Guild Name
-- [Primary Coder]: Agent ID
-- [QA Verified By]: Agent ID
-- [JSON Ref]: File Path & Table Key
